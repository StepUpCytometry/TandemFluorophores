# Help us update the list!

Want to help update our list and add citations? We welcome your contributions. 

The easiest way to do so is to download the TandemFluorophores.csv file located [here](data/TandemFluorophores.csv), update it, and then send it back to us (either by email, via Discord, or opening an issue here on GitHub).
